    **Connection Pool Remediation Playbook**
    
    1. **Immediate Actions**
       - Scale connection pool size by 50%
       - Restart application services in rolling fashion
       - Monitor connection pool metrics
    
    2. **Investigation Steps**
       - Analyze connection usage patterns
       - Review application logs for connection errors
       - Check database performance metrics
    
    3. **Validation**
       - Verify connection pool utilization is below 80%
       - Confirm no connection timeout errors
       - Monitor for 24 hours for stability
  priority: "high"
