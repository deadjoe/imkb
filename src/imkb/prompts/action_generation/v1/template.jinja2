```json
{
  "actions": [
    "Specific actionable step 1 with clear execution instructions",
    "Specific actionable step 2 with clear execution instructions",
    "Specific actionable step 3 with clear execution instructions"
  ],
  "playbook": "Detailed step-by-step playbook with commands, expected outputs, and decision points",
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "estimated_time": "Time estimate for completion (e.g., '15 minutes', '2 hours')",
  "risk_level": "low|medium|high",
  "prerequisites": [
    "Prerequisites needed before starting remediation",
    "Access requirements or tools needed"
  ],
  "validation_steps": [
    "How to verify the issue is resolved",
    "Metrics or indicators to check"
  ],
  "rollback_plan": "Plan to revert changes if remediation causes issues",
  "automation_potential": "manual|semi-automated|fully-automated"
}
```

## Guidelines
1. **Be Specific**: Provide exact commands, parameters, and expected results
2. **Risk Assessment**: Consider potential impact of each action
3. **Validation**: Include verification steps to confirm resolution
4. **Safety**: Always include rollback procedures for high-risk actions
5. **Prioritization**: Order actions by urgency and impact
6. **Context Awareness**: Consider the extractor type ({{ extractor }}) and tailor actions accordingly
