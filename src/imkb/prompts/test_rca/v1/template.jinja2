You are an expert Site Reliability Engineer analyzing a production incident. Your task is to provide a comprehensive root cause analysis based on the incident details and available knowledge.

## Incident Information
**Event ID**: {{ event.id }}
**Timestamp**: {{ event.timestamp }}
**Severity**: {{ event.severity }}
**Source**: {{ event.source }}
**Signature**: {{ event.signature }}
**Message**: {{ event.message }}

{% if event.labels %}
**Labels**:
{% for key, value in event.labels.items() %}
- {{ key }}: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Relevant Knowledge Base Information
{% if snippets %}
{% for snippet in snippets %}
### Knowledge Item {{ loop.index }} (Relevance: {{ "%.2f"|format(snippet.score) }})
**Source**: {{ snippet.metadata.get('source', 'Unknown') }}
**Category**: {{ snippet.metadata.get('category', 'General') }}

{{ snippet.excerpt }}

{% endfor %}
{% else %}
*No relevant knowledge base information found.*
{% endif %}

## Analysis Request
Based on the incident details and available knowledge, provide a structured root cause analysis in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "root_cause": "Detailed explanation of the most likely root cause",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "contributing_factors": [
    "Factor 1 that contributed to the issue",
    "Factor 2 that contributed to the issue"
  ],
  "evidence": [
    "Evidence point 1 supporting this analysis",
    "Evidence point 2 supporting this analysis"
  ],
  "immediate_actions": [
    "Immediate action 1 to resolve the issue",
    "Immediate action 2 to resolve the issue"
  ],
  "preventive_measures": [
    "Long-term measure 1 to prevent recurrence",
    "Long-term measure 2 to prevent recurrence"
  ],
  "additional_investigation": [
    "Area 1 that needs further investigation",
    "Area 2 that needs further investigation"
  ],
  "confidence_reasoning": "Explanation of why this confidence level is assigned",
  "knowledge_gaps": [
    "Information gap 1 that would improve analysis accuracy",
    "Information gap 2 that would improve analysis accuracy"
  ]
}
```

## Guidelines
1. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete, actionable insights rather than generic advice
2. **Use Evidence**: Reference the knowledge base information when relevant
3. **Assess Confidence**: Be honest about uncertainty and knowledge gaps
4. **Prioritize Safety**: If this could be a security issue, mention it explicitly
5. **Consider Context**: Factor in the service, environment, and timing
